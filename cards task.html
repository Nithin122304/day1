          Madara is able to use multiple chakra natures. As an Uchiha, Madara is
          able to use Fire style jutsu. Madara's fire ball jutsu can encompass a
          large distances and can swallow many opponents. Madara can also use
          the Wood style jutsu since he implanted Hashirama's cell into his
          body.Madara Uchiha (Japanese: うちは マダラ, Hepburn: Uchiha Madara)
          is a main antagonist manga and anime character in the Naruto series
          created by Masashi Kishimoto. He appears for the first time in "Part
          II" of the manga and the Shippuden anime adaptation, as a major
          antagonist. He, along with its first Hokage Hashirama Senju, is one of
          the co-founders of Konohagakure (Japanese: 木ノ葉隠れの里, Hepburn:
          Konohagakure no Sato) village from the ninja world. Their power
          conflict over how to run the village, as well as the long-term feud
          between clans, leads to Madara's death. However, it is revealed later
          that Madara had used a man named Obito Uchiha as his agent. He
          transplants his Rinnegan (輪廻眼, lit. "Saṃsāra Eye") eye power into a
          child named Nagato, a member of the terrorist organization Akatsuki,
          to be preserved for his eventual revival years later. During most of
          the series, Obito uses Madara's name until a criminal named Kabuto
          Yakushi reanimates the real Madara who becomes one of the primary
          antagonists alongside Obito Uchiha during the Fourth Great Shinobi
          World War storyline. Madara has appeared in several pieces of Naruto
          media, including a Boruto feature film. Many Naruto video games have
          featured him as a playable character. Kishimoto created the character
          to provide a strong villain in the series' final arc who would face
          the series' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki. This confrontation would be
          different from that with previous enemies and result in more of a
          focus on fight scenes. Merchandise has been released in Madara's
          likeness, including keychains, plush dolls, and figurines. In the
          Japanese anime, Naoya Uchida voices Madara, while Go Inoue voices him
          as a child. In the English version, Neil Kaplan provides Madara's
          voice with Xander Mobus voicing him as a child. Critics have commented
          on his role as an antagonist in the series; some have placed him on
          top all-time anime villains lists, while others have criticized his
          effectiveness. Nevertheless, Madara's background was well-received for
          how integral his story is to the series' scenario.

          Naruto Uzumaki (Japanese: うずまき ナルト, Hepburn: Uzumaki Naruto)
          (/ˈnɑːrutoʊ/) is the titular protagonist of the manga Naruto, created
          by Masashi Kishimoto. He is a ninja from the fictional Hidden Leaf
          Village (Japanese: 木ノ葉隠れ, Hepburn: konohagakure). As a boy,
          Naruto is ridiculed and ostracized on account of the Nine-Tailed Demon
          Fox—a malevolent creature that attacked Konohagakure—that was sealed
          away in his body. Despite this, he aspires to become his village's
          leader, the Hokage, in order to receive their approval. His carefree,
          optimistic, and boisterous personality enables him to befriend other
          Konohagakure ninja, as well as ninja from other villages. Naruto
          appears in the series' films and in other media related to the
          franchise, including video games and original video animations (OVA),
          as well as the sequel Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, where he is the
          Hokage, and his son, Boruto Uzumaki, is the protagonist. When creating
          Naruto for the initial part of the series, Kishimoto kept the
          character "simple and stupid", while giving him many attributes of an
          ideal hero. Kishimoto gave Naruto a dark side by adding tragedy to the
          character's past. He has revised Naruto's image many times, providing
          the character with simple clothes to fit the young demography.
          Kishimoto changed his design for Part II of the storyline, which
          starts two-and-a-half years after Part I. Naruto is voiced by Junko
          Takeuchi in the original animated series and Maile Flanagan in the
          English adaptations. Merchandise based on Naruto includes figurines
          and keychains. Naruto's character development has been praised by
          anime and manga publications and has drawn scholarly attention.
          Although some initially saw him as a typical manga and anime
          protagonist comparable to those in other shōnen manga, others have
          praised his personality and character development as he avoids
          stereotypes typically seen in similar media. The character has also
          been the subject of researches in literature, making him stand out in
          fiction based on his traits and growth.

          Sasuke Uchiha (Japanese: うちは サスケ, Hepburn: Uchiha Sasuke)
          (/ˈsɑːskeɪ/) is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime
          franchise created by Masashi Kishimoto. Sasuke belongs to the Uchiha
          clan, a notorious ninja family, and one of the most powerful, allied
          with Konohagakure (木ノ葉隠れの里, English version: "Hidden Leaf
          Village"). Most of its members were massacred by Sasuke's older
          brother, Itachi Uchiha, before the series began, leaving Sasuke one of
          the few living. Despite becoming empathetic toward his teammates
          Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, Sasuke's feelings of powerlessness
          force him to abandon his friends and his home in his quest to become
          stronger, and to find Orochimaru. Sasuke appears in several of the
          series' animated feature films and related media, including video
          games, original video animations (OVAs), and Boruto: Naruto the Movie
          (2015) and its manga sequel, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (2016),
          in which he is depicted as a vigilante supporting his village and a
          mentor to Naruto's son Boruto Uzumaki. Kishimoto conceived Sasuke as a
          rival of the series' title character Naruto Uzumaki. Despite Sasuke's
          dark character development later in the story, Kishimoto avoided
          portraying him as a villain; he found designing the character
          challenging and had difficulty creating a suitable look for him.
          Nonetheless, Kishimoto has grown to enjoy drawing him. In the manga's
          animated adaptations, Sasuke was voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in
          Japanese and Yuri Lowenthal in English. Sasuke's character has
          received mixed responses from anime and manga publications. His
          impressive fighting skills, plot contribution, and rivalry with Naruto
          Uzumaki received some praise, but he was criticized as a stereotypical
          rival in the mold of similar characters from other shōnen manga and as
          exhibiting a cold personality. Nevertheless, Sasuke's characterization
          in latter parts of the story and more mature personality in the Boruto
          sequel earned further positive comments. Sasuke has also placed highly
          in Naruto reader popularity polls and has also been the subject of
          studies by scholars. Character-based merchandise, including action
          figures and key chains, have been released.

        <p class="p4">
          Nagato (Japanese: 長門), known primarily under the alias of Pain
          (ペイン, Pein), is a fictional character in the manga and anime series
          Naruto created by Masashi Kishimoto. Nagato is the figurehead leader
          of the Akatsuki who wishes to capture the tailed beasts sealed into
          various people around the shinobi world. After acquiring and sealing
          most of the beasts within a Gedo statue, Nagato's advisor advises him
          to capture the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox sealed inside the series'
          protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki (whom he turns out to be related to).
          Before leaving to capture Naruto, Nagato engages in a mortal battle
          with his former mentor, Jiraiya. His past as a war orphan, and his
          loss of his best friend are explored. Due to his traumatic
          experiences, which stemmed from human conflict, Nagato aims to create
          a new world, free from the chaos of war. Nagato also appears in the
          series' video games. Nagato was conceived by Kishimoto as a villain, a
          victim of war, who would show Naruto the impact of world wars,
          something Kishimoto aimed to explore throughout the series. While
          Nagato does not fight in the story, he uses a group of corpses known
          as "The Six Paths of Pain" (ペイン六道, Pein Rikudō). All of them were
          given elaborate designs with multiple piercings across their bodies to
          reinforce the idea that despite his calm demeanor, Nagato is a
          dangerous person. Critical response to Nagato's character has been
          generally positive, praising the chaos he brings to the story,
          including the murder of Jiraiya and the destruction of Konoha itself
          while chasing Naruto. His eventual fight against Naruto has been
          regarded as one of the best battles in the entire series. This is due
          not only to the techniques used by both fighters, but because of their
          interactions in relation to the chaos of wars. Because of this,
          Kishimoto was able to bring more depth to a series aimed at a young
          demographic.
